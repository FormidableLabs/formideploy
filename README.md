Deployment helpers for everything Formidable website-related. This tool helps our base website and open source landers projects:

* Serve a production build in localdev
* Deploy the build to staging (`surge.sh`)
* Deploy the build to production (AWS)

## Integration

Formideploy helps serve and deploy for our main website ([`formidable.com`](https://formidable.com)) and our various project landers (e.g., [`spectacle/docs`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/tree/master/docs) served at [`formidable.com/open-source/spectacle`](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle)).

Project integration entails configuration within a repository and secrets placed into CI.

### Repository configuration

To add `formideploy` to your project, first add it via yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add --dev formideploy
```

Typically, you'll then want some helper `package.json:scripts` wrappers:

```js
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "**NOTE**: Not part of formideploy, but should remove all previous distributions",
  "build": "**NOTE**: Not part of formideploy, but should produce a full prod distribution",
  "serve": "formideploy serve",
  "deploy:stage": "formideploy deploy --staging",
  "deploy:prod": "formideploy deploy --production",
}
```

And then you'll need to override some configuration variables.

Please open up and read all of [`lib/config/defaults.js`](./lib/config/defaults.js) (particularly the fields with `REQUIRED` comments). The configuration file is self-documenting for everything that you will need to integrate your project.

You will then need to override the applicable defaults with a configuration file in the current working directory from which you run `formideploy` named `formideploy.config.js`. The overrides can be either a function that takes as input the default configuration and mutates it, or an object which is deep merged into the defaults.

Here are both ways of doing the necessary overrides:

```js
// formideploy.config.js (Object Version)
module.exports = {
  lander: {
    name: "spectacle"
  }
};
```

```js
// formideploy.config.js (Function Version)
module.exports = (cfg) => {
  cfg.lander.name = "spectacle";
  return cfg;
};
```

### Localdev

#### AWS

If you  want to do production deploys / testing locally on your machine, you'll need the AWS CLI:

```sh
$ brew install awscli
```

Then, set up `aws-vault` with the AWS access and secret keys for an entry named `AWS IAM ({LANDER_NAME}-ci)` of `AWS IAM (formidable-com-ci)` for the base website in the IC vault:

```sh
$ brew cask install aws-vault
$ aws-vault add fmd-{LANDER_NAME}-ci
# Enter AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY values for AWS `{LANDER_NAME}-ci` user
```

For a quick check to confirm that everything works, try:

```sh
$ aws-vault exec fmd-{LANDER_NAME}-ci -- \
  aws s3 ls s3://formidable.com
```

and you should see a listing of files for the base website.

### CI

The following section discusses how to hook up staging and production deploys in your CI.

#### Secrets

We maintain our secrets in 1password and the relevant credentials can be found in the `Individual Contributor IC` vault. Most of the secrets we need are environment variables that need to be added to CI.

**Travis**: See the [encryption guide](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/#usage). We recommend using the Ruby gem and manually outputting the secret to shell, then adding it to your `.travis.yml` with a comment about what the environment variable name is. For example, if our secret was `SURGE_TOKEN=HASHYHASHYHASH`, we would first encrypt it in a terminal to stdout:

```sh
$ travis encrypt SURGE_TOKEN=HASHYHASHYHASH
  secure: "BIG_OL_GIBBERISH_STRING="
```

Then add that to your `.travis.yml` making sure to place the variable name in a comment so we know which environment var the secret corresponds to:

```yml
env:
  global:
    # SURGE_TOKEN
    - secure: "BIG_OL_GIBBERISH_STRING="
```

**CircleCI**:

#### GitHub Integration

We get PR deployment notifications and links via the GitHub [deployments](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) API.

Each lander and the base website have dedicated GitHub users that should be used for CI integration with `formideploy`. If a user for a given lander does not exist, please reach out to Roemer or Lauren to have us create one. You should **never** use a personal access token for CI integration.

Find the appropriate GitHub user in the 1password `Individual Contributor IC` vault, most likely named `GitHub ({LANDER_NAME}-ci)`.

* Base website example: `GitHub (formidable-com-ci)`
* Lander examples: `GitHub (spectacle-ci)`, `GitHub (urql-ci)`, ...

**Add `GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN`**: Once you've found the relevant entry in 1password, look to the `Tokens` section for a `GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` key and token value and add it to your environment variable secrets in CI. If the information is missing, please reach out to Roemer, who will create one (https://github.com/settings/tokens with permissions only for `repo_deployment`).

#### Staging CI

Deploying to staging requires the following secrets from the `Individual Contributor IC` vault encrypted into your CI environment.

* `Surge.sh`: Look in the notes section.
    * **Add `SURGE_LOGIN`**
    * **Add `SURGE_TOKEN`**

**Travis**: For Travis CI users, we will then need a dedicated deployment job. Here's a good example:

```yml
jobs:
  include:
    - stage: documentation
      node_js: '12'
      script:
        # Switch to docs location, install and check.
        - cd docs
        - yarn install --frozen-lockfile
        - yarn run check-ci
        # Build docs.
        - yarn run clean
        - yarn run build
        # Deploy to staging.
        - yarn run deploy:stage
```

`formideploy` is only involved in the last step (`yarn run deploy:stage` assuming you wrapped up a command as we recommend). But the overall job structure just runs **one** staging deployment per PR commit no matter what your build matrix otherwise looks like.

#### Production CI

- [ ] `TODO: Getting secrets from 1password.`
- [ ] `TODO: Integrating into Travis.`
- [ ] `TODO(10): Add section on jobs into CircleCI. (urql)` (https://github.com/FormidableLabs/formideploy/issues/10)

## Actions

### Serve

Serve your build (specified at `build.dir`) with:

```sh
$ formideploy serve
$ formideploy serve --port 3333

# ... which should be scripted in package.json as ...
$ yarn serve
```

And then look for at the terminal logs for localhost website to view, e.g.:

```sh
[serve] Serving build from "dist/open-source/spectacle" at: http://localhost:4000/open-source/spectacle
```

### Deploy: Staging

Deploy your build (at `build.dir`) to `https://{domain.staging}/{site.basePath)}` with:

```sh
$ formideploy deploy --staging --dryrun # Skips actual deploy
$ formideploy deploy --staging

# ... which should be scripted in package.json as ...
$ yarn deploy:stage --dryrun
$ yarn deploy:stage
```

And then look for at the terminal logs for staging website to view, e.g.:

```sh
[deploy:staging] Publish success for: https://formidable-com-spectacle-staging-333.surge.sh/open-source/spectacle
```

If you want to do a manual deploy from localdev, use simulated environment variables to actually trigger the deploy:

```sh
$ SURGE_LOGIN=<SNIPPED> \
  SURGE_TOKEN=<SNIPPED> \
  FORMIDEPLOY_BUILD_ID=<MAKE_UP_A_NUMBER_OR_STRING> \
  yarn deploy:stage
```

_Note_: Localdev deploys will skip GitHub deployment PR integration.
